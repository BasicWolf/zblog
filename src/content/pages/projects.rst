Concrete Settings
-----------------

**Concrete Settings** is a Python library which facilitates
configuration management in big and small programs.

The project was born out of necessity to manage a huge
decade-old Django-based SaaS solution with more than two hundred
different application settings scattered around ``settings.py``.
*What does this setting do?*
*What type is it?*
*Why does it have such a weird format?*
*Is this the final value, or it changes somewhere on the way?*

Concrete Settigns tackles these problems altogether.
It was designed to be developer and end-user friendly.
The settings are defined via normal Python code with few
tricks which significantly improve readability
and maintainability.
