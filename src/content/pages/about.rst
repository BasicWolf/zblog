Hello, I'm Zaur. It's nice to meet you on my website.

I was always obsessed with electronic equipment. There is something magical
in devices with hundreds of blinking lamps, silent and loud clicks, moving
and rotating parts. And then, when I was 4 years old, I saw a computer.
Whoa! DOS games were amazing! And there was something else: BASIC.

Many years passed. I got a bachelor's degree in computer science at Saint
Petersburg State Polytechnival University and master's degree at University
of Eastern Finland. I still love programming and think of it as an art.
I love beautiful ideas and their implementation in code.

I live in Finland and work in Keycore OY, developing state of the art
GIS and CAD software.
The other part of my life is my Family, science fiction, interesting
science-related books, mountain biking in summer and snowboarding in winter.
