:summary: I have graduated!

Ladies and Gentlemen!

I have graduated! Four years of master studies at the University of Eastern
Finland and finally, it is done. I'd like to thank everyone who helped and
supported me these years, my family, my friends, my colleagues at Blancco
and first of all my supervisor Dr. Tomi Kinnunen.

The thesis is about Voice activity detection (VAD). You may be surprised
to hear that you use it every day when speaking by mobile phone or Skype.
It is a small module that detects whether the input signal from a microphone
contains speech or not. Consider a typical phone conversation: you are
speaking for half of the time and listen for another half. That's when
a VAD decides that there is no need to transfer any data from your microphone
to another end of the conversation. It saves your battery and network
bandwidth a lot.

So, without any further hesitation, here is the

I hope you will my thesis interesting and will enjoy reading it.
