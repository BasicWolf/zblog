:summary: The worst thing has happened: I have an unexpected drive failure. That's how my Easter has started :(


Few tools I can use right now:

* Ubuntu 8.10 Live CD (without Ext4 suppor!)
* A usb flash drive
* A two month-old backup (agh!)


I'm writing this post in Ubuntu loaded from LiveCD. Right now, I'm downloading
Ubuntu 10.04 and RIPLinux distribution. I hope everything will be fine :)

Update\@3.00 AM
---------------
Some files are corrupted, but I was able to backup projects and master thesis
materials. Now, backing up thunderbird directory.


Update\@6.55 AM
---------------
There are more than 2 millions bad sectors on the drive. I'm lucky to have
two external USB SATA drives. I hope that the only thing I've missed this
night - were sweet dreams :)

Update\@8.39 AM
---------------
Ubuntu 10.04 Beta is installed and updated. Too tired to write how BAD I
felt about it. Looks like I have to move on. Long ago, when I lived and
studied in Saint Petersburg, me and my roommate Vova had frequent
conversations about Linux world. Ubuntu was new, still, as Vova said,
"There is always will be Debian".
I'm downloading Debian Testing right now. Thank you for everything
you've taught me, Ubuntu!


Update\@21.00
-------------
What the HELL! I never thought that Debian will cause so many problems. 
First, there is no iwlagn4945 firmware in first installation CD. And I
don't have an Ethernet cable to connect and download everything required
for normal network support. Agh. I'm getting back to Ubuntu :)
