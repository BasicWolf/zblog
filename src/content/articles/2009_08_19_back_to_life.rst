:summary: There were no blog updates during 8 month! But I am finally back to life!

Lots of things happened. I have recently finished my IT Project (as a part
of my studies).

.. epigraph::

   VADpy is a universal, modular, easy-to-run and easy-to-extend Voice
   Activity Detection algorithms testing framework that puts different
   speech/sound databases, VADs, error metrics and performance reports
   in one place. VADpy saves developers time by providing convinient MATLAB
   interface for MATLAB-based VADs. A powerful modular architecture lets
   developers integrate any kind of file databases and VADs into the framework.
   The Python programming language provides convinient environment to develop
   input, error metric and output modules.

I learned lots of new things about Python while working on this project.
I hope to share this knowledge in my blog.

Also, I got rid out of static html, now the blog runs on Django. The
"engine" is still in development (comments with captcha are on their way)
yet, the blog is fully-functional and you're welcome to read it.
