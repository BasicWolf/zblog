:summary: Ah, magnificent Finnish winter! First, it was jumping around zero (Celsius of course), so that people had to deal with slippery roads and pavement, then it dropped to -25, so that people put on layers of clothes. Then a snowstorm hit Finland, and it was above -10 again, with mountains of snow. There is an important part of the wardrobe that helps dealing with all these weather conditions: the **shoes**.

Why?
----
My old boots' life was coming to an end. They are 5 years old and
have served me very well. Considering the winter in Finland, investing
into warm, water-proof and well-breathing winter boots with a tough
iced surface grip is a must.


When?
-----
Christmas sales? After New year discounts? Nonsense!

I believe that the best time to buy cloths is a time close to the end
of a season. It is hard to call the end of January an "end of the season",
nevertheless you may find that huge discounts on various seasonal cloths
have already started. Certainly, there are even bigger discounts after
the season ends - but then, the choice is extremely limited.
If you get lucky - the discount can be dramatic. For example: we bought
new roller skates for my wife, with a 75% discount in September. It
was the last pair of the required size :)


Where?
------

I consider ordering shoes online a risky business. Time is money and it
takes time for the shoes to arrive and if they don't fit - it takes
time for the backward process.
On the other hand, online stores have better price offers and discounts.
The best ones include a "send it back" post tag into the original package
which can be used to send the shoes back to the shop if they don't fit.



Who?
----

Extreme Nordic weather requires solid Nordic shoes to deal with it.
Some of you have probably heard of Danish ECCO_. I've been buying ECCO shoes,
sandals, pumps, boots, trainers for years. Finally, I've got so assured
with them, that I ordered new winter boots online. They came with a nice
40% discount, which decreased the price from 225 to 135 EUR. Now, 135 EUR
may seem quite a price, but hey, if you expect at least 3-4 years of
service, it drops to ~39 EUR/year. Isn't that a bargain?! Hell, my *monthly*
Internet bill is about that amount of money. So, here it is ECCO Roxton:

The official ad says:

Warm up to Winter, in these sheepskin-lined 100% waterproof boots.

* Lace up, high-cut boot style with metal D-rings and speed lacing system
* Designed for premium comfort, warmth and insulation
* Uppers of oiled nubuck, suede and textile - for durability and a comfortable fit
* Warm lining of lambskin and wool provides superior, natural insulation
* Gore-texÂ® lining provides a 100% waterproof guarantee, ensuring dry feet at all times
* Direct-injected sole provides lightweight durability, flexibility and won't weigh you down

It took me a week to wear them in. The boots are a bit heavier than my
old ones and have a thicker sole. After a week I can sincerely say, that
these are the best winter boots I owned ever! Thank you, ECCO!
