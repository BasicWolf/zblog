:summary: I'm sure, you know, who Albert Einstein is. I remember the basic Relativity Theory course taught at 10th grade of school. That's when I first met Einstein's ideas. It was hard to believe that c, the speed of light - is the maximum speed in the Universe. It was hard to understand, why a time in a spaceship that achieves a speed close to c runs slower and slower. Albert Einstein explained it all. He published more than 300 scientific and over 150 non-scientific works. He is considered the father of modern physics and is probably the most successful scientist there ever was. I think we should learn a lot from him. Wandering around the web, I ran into a wonderful "10 Amazing Life Lessons You Can Learn From Albert Einstein" article by `Mr. Self Development <http://www.mrselfdevelopment.com/about/>`_ I loved Einstein's advices very much. And here they are:


1. Follow Your Curiosity
------------------------

.. epigraph::

   *I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.*


What piques your curiosity? I am curious as to what causes one person to
succeed while another person fails; this is why I’ve spent years studying
success. What are you most curious about? The pursuit of your curiosity is
the secret to your success.



2. Perseverance is Priceless
----------------------------

.. epigraph::

   *It's not that I'm so smart; it's just that I stay with problems longer.*

Through perseverance the turtle reached the ark. Are you willing to persevere
until you get to your intended destination? They say the entire value of the
postage stamp consist in its ability to stick to something until it gets there.
Be like the postage stamp; finish the race that you’ve started!

3. Focus on the Present
-----------------------

.. epigraph::

   *Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply not
   giving the kiss the attention it deserves.*

My father always says you cannot ride two horses at the same time. I like to
say, you can do anything, but not everything. Learn to be present where you are;
give your all to whatever you’re currently doing.

Focused energy is power, and it’s the difference between success and failure.

4. The Imagination is Powerful
------------------------------

.. epigraph::

   *Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.
   Imagination is more important than knowledge.*

Are you using your imagination daily? Einstein said the imagination is more
important than knowledge! Your imagination pre-plays your future. Einstein
went on to say, “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but
imagination.” Are you exercising your “imagination muscles” daily, don’t
let something as powerful as your imagination lie dormant.

5. Make Mistakes
----------------

.. epigraph::

   *A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.*

Never be afraid of making a mistake. A mistake is not a failure. Mistakes
can make you better, smarter and faster, if you utilize them properly.
Discover the power of making mistakes. I’ve said this before, and I’ll
say it again, if you want to succeed, triple the amount of mistakes that you make.

6. Live in the Moment
---------------------

.. epigraph::

   *I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.*

The only way to properly address your future is to be as present as possible
“in the present.”

You cannot “presently” change yesterday or tomorrow, so it’s of supreme
importance that you dedicate all of your efforts to “right now.” It’s the
only time that matters, it’s the only time there is.

7. Create Value
---------------

.. epigraph::

   *Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.*

Don’t waste your time trying to be successful, spend your time creating
value. If you’re valuable, then you will attract success.

Discover the talents and gifts that you possess, learn how to offer those
talents and gifts in a way that most benefits others.

Labor to be valuable and success will chase you down.

8. Don’t Expect Different Results
---------------------------------

.. epigraph::

   *Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different
   results.*

You can’t keep doing the same thing everyday and expect different results.
In other words, you can’t keep doing the same workout routine and expect to
look differently. In order for your life to change, you must change, to the
degree that you change your actions and your thinking is to the degree that
your life will change.

9. Knowledge Comes From Experience
----------------------------------

.. epigraph::

   *Information is not knowledge. The only source of knowledge is experience.*

Knowledge comes from experience. You can discuss a task, but discussion
will only give you a philosophical understanding of it; you must experience
the task first hand to “know it.” What’s the lesson? Get experience! Don’t
spend your time hiding behind speculative information, go out there and do
it, and you will have gained priceless knowledge.

10. Learn the Rules and Then Play Better
----------------------------------------

.. epigraph::

   *You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better
   than anyone else.*

To put it all in simple terms, there are two things that you must do. The
first thing you must do is to learn the rules of the game that you’re playing.
It doesn’t sound exciting, but it’s vital. Secondly, you must commit to play
the game better than anyone else. If you can do these two things, success will
be yours!
